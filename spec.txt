A Space object is a sequence of bits/bytes/characters(hereafter abbreviated
as chars). There are two special chars in Space which turn an otherwise
unstructured linear sequence of chars into a structured recursive object.

Those two special chars are:

space character
Keyboard: Space Key
Binary: 00100000
Hex: 20
Decimal: 32

newline character
Keyboard: Enter Key
Binary: 00001010
Hex: 0A
Decimal: 10

At a higher level, a Space object consists of a sequence of pairs.

A pair holds two sequences of chars (hereafter referred to as strings):
one named "Property" and one named "Value".

"Property" is a sequence of any char other than the space char or newline char.
"Property" is terminated by a space char or newline. If "Property" is terminated
by a space char, its associated "Value" will be a string. If "Property" is
terminated by a newline char, its associated "Value" will be a Space object.
If "Property" is terminated by an end-of-file char its associated "Value" will be
an empty Space object.

"Value" can contain any char, but newline chars must be escaped. To escape a
newline char in "Value", precede the newline char with a newline char + N space
chars, where N is equal to the number of spaces preceding the "Property" + 1.
"Value" is terminated by an unescaped newline char. "Value" can also be
terminated by an end-of-file char.

This is the full spec of Space.
